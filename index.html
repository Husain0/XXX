        <div id = "dash"></div>
        <p>I like coding a lot! This is one of my favourite hobby. My day is incomplete without coding. I like to do web development a lot.
        I am learning more about it and always excited to learn more. I like the HTML and PYTHON a lot. I haven't learn PYTHON yet but want to. When I have free time then I spend time with coding. It makes my day refreshing.</p>
